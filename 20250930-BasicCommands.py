# This is a variable, initially set to contain the value 3:
a = 3  # variable a equals 3
my_var = 40000


# You can print the variable:
print (a)



# You can print operations with the variables. In Python a multiplication operatior is written '*':
print (a*10)


# You can (and in fact should) also print messages in the same print() command:
    
print('the value of the variable a is ', a)
print('a multiplied by 10 is:', a*10)


# Variables can also be of non-numerical types, such as a string:

city = 'Cork'  # the 

print(city)

# Variables can be changed. Strings can have spaces and special characters:
    
city = 'Cork is a beautiful city'

print(city)
